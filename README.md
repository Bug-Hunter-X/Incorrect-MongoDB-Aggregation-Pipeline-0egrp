# Incorrect MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline
This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines where the $sum operator is used incorrectly, leading to unexpected results or errors. The problem arises when attempting to sum non-numeric fields, resulting in an incorrect or unexpected aggregation.
The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected implementation.
## Bug Description
The aggregation pipeline attempts to sum the values of the field `anotherField` within the `$group` stage. However, if `anotherField` contains non-numeric data types (e.g., strings, dates), the $sum operator will fail or yield an unexpected result. This can lead to inaccurate analysis and reporting based on the aggregated data.
## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that `anotherField` contains only numeric values.  If this is not possible, alternative aggregation approaches or data transformations might be necessary (e.g., using $toInt to convert strings to numbers if the data format allows for this).
